## Plaid Party Planning III

Reversing (500 pts)

This year, we're having another party. We managed to come to a consensus to have [Indian food](https://play.plaidctf.com/files/pppiii-b73804b431586f8ecd4a0e8c0daf3ba6), but I can't figure out where everyone should sit. Can you help us make sure the dinner goes off without a hitch?

[This binary](https://play.plaidctf.com/files/pppiii_450cfae15d4434c4f5fe320fae78ec40) has a fix for an unintentional solution. Let's keep the party going. 

NOTE: We have pushed an updated binary. This update fixes a bug in the check function and should hopefully make the check function easier to understand. The diff with the binary below should be minimal. Apologies.

Hint: Admin contact
Please message strikeskids on IRC (#pctf on freenode) if you have a solution that should pass the check, but does not give a valid flag.

Let's do this together. You do know how to [count](https://play.plaidctf.com/files/i_can_count_8484ceff57cb99e3bdb3017f8c8a2467), don't you?

## The .Wat ness

The .Wat ness is open for testing! 

`http://watness.pwni.ng:7744/`

When it came out in 2016, the Witness impressed with its ability to gradually teach new players the rules of the game by simply having them play it. With the .Wat ness, we take this just a small step further.
