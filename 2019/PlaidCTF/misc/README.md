You'll have a whale of a time with [this one](https://play.plaidctf.com/files/pctf-whales_169aeb74f82dcdceb76e36a6c4c22a89)! I couldn't decide what I wanted the flag to be so I alternated adding and removing stuff in waves until I got something that looked good. Can you dive right in and tell me what was so punny?
