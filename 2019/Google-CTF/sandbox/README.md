# Sandbox

## sandbox-caas - 363 pts

Solves: 10

We realized that there was a distinct lack of cloud based computation services
and thus decided do create something new.

It is making use of the latest super-advanced security features of the linux
kernel:

- 100% seccomp protection
- *ALL* the namespaces (wow!)
- rlimit thingies

We provide you with the source code as well as a demo instance so that you can
evaluate our high quality service.
